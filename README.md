- Each folder contains algorithm implementations and a dedicated `Main` class for running tests.

## 💻 How to run

Open the repository folder in **Visual Studio Code** and:

1. Open the specific `Main` class file you want to run (e.g., `MainSorting.java` for sorting algorithms).
2. Use the built-in Java debugger or terminal to compile and run that `Main` class.
3. Modify or add test cases directly inside the chosen `Main` class.

## 📖 Algorithms Covered

- **Sorting:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Graphs:** Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Knapsack Problem, etc.
