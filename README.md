- Each folder contains algorithm implementations and a dedicated `Main` class for running tests.

## 💻 How to run

Open the repository folder in **Visual Studio Code** and:

1. Open the specific `Main` class file you want to run (e.g., `MainSorting.java` for sorting algorithms).
2. At the top of `MainSorting.java`, you'll find:

   ```java
   private static final String SORTING_ALGORITHM = "MergeSort";
   ```

   Replace "MergeSort" with the name of the algorithm class you want to run.

4. Use the Java terminal or debugger to compile and run the selected file.
